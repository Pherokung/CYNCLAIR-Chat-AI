Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/mediatek: Fix coverity issue with unintentional integer overflow. Instead of multiplying two variables of different types, the fix involves assigning a value to one variable and then multiplying the other variable. Additionally, an integer variable is added for multiplier calculation instead of calculating different types of multipliers with the dma_addr_t variable directly.
