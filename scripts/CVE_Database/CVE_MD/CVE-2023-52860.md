Description: In the Linux kernel, a vulnerability has been resolved in the drivers/perf section. Specifically, the issue was with the 'hisi_hns3' PMU teardown process, where CPU hotplug callbacks were mistakenly run after the device was unregistered, causing kernel NULL pointer dereference errors. The fix involves using cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() instead of cpuhp_state_remove_instance() to prevent notifiers from executing post-unregistration.
